    Generate a matrix S to be used in the Clarkson-Woodruff sketch.
    Given the size of a desired matrix, the method returns a matrix S of size (n_rows, n_columns)
    where each column has all the entries set to 0 less one position with has been randomly set to
    +1 o -1 with equal probability.
    Parameters
    ----------
    n_rows: int
        number of rows of S
    n_columns: int
        number of columns of S
    Returns
    -------
    S : (n_rows, n_columns) array_like

    This is an implementation of the Clarckson-Woodruff Transform (also known as CountSketch) introduced for
    first time in Kenneth L. Clarkson and David P. Woodruff. Low rank approximation and regression in input sparsity time. In STOC, 2013.
    A' can be computed in O(nnz(A)) but we don't take advantage of sparse matrix in this implementation
